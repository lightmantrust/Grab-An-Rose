👉 After creating this file in GitHub (`README.md` in root), your repo will have a professional landing page.  

Would you like me to also generate a **step-by-step “developer onboarding guide”** (separate `docs/ONBOARDING.md`) so new devs know exactly how to set up environment, Redis, Postgres, and run mobile + backend locally?
